   <h1>vim: The Best Text Editor</h1>
   <p>
   I love vim.
   I don't know why and I'm not going to try to convince <em>you</em> to love it.

   <h2>vim settings</h2>
   <p>
   To change vim settings, you need to change the vimrc file.
   On Linux, this is at: ~/.vimrc.
   On Windows, this is at: C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\_vimrc.
   I also use gvim a lot which is vim with a gui.
   After all a mouse is pretty useful.
   Settings for gvim are found in the gvimrc file in the same location as the vimrc file.
   <h3>My vimrc file for all platforms</h3>
   <pre>
   set expandtab           " tabs to spaces
   set shiftwidth=3        " four spaces for tabs
   set softtabstop=3       " columns for a tab in insert mode
   set autoindent          " indent to same level
   set number              " line numbers
   set colorcolumn=73      " Add line in column 81
   set hlsearch            " highlight searches
   set incsearch           " start highlighting in search immediately
   set wrap                " wrap text
   syntax on               " Turn on syntax highlighting
   set showmatch           " Show matching braces
   set linebreak           " Wrap at words
   colorscheme elflord     " Common dark colorscheme
   set ruler               " Show character number info
    
   " For makefiles, require tabs and not spaces
   autocmd FileType make set noexpandtab
   autocmd FileType make set tabstop=3
   </pre>
   <h3>My gvimrc file for Windows</h3>
   <pre>
   set nobackup              " Turn off backups after quit
   set nowritebackup         " Turn off backups during edit
   set noundofile            " Turn off persistent undo
   set lines=45 columns=90   " Number of lines and columns (used on linux too)
   set guifont=Consolas:h11  " Font
   set bs=2                  " Backspace behavior needed on Windows
